<p>PHILANTHROPIC EVENT – Schwinn is participating in the Pedal for Good Community Food Drive and will have a food donation bin to combat food insecurity in our region. Please bring a toiletry or non-perishable food item to drop off before you ride one of the Ride Spot Challenges! The donation bin will be at the front door of the Pacific Cycle building and can be accessed during normal business hours (8am-5pm Monday through Friday). Feeding America predicts food insecurity will affect 12% of the Dane County population. That’s an increase of 63%, meaning 24,620 more people will need help this year!</p>

<p>Throughout the U.S., women* bike less than men* for transportation, recreation, and sport. Why? Even in Madison, which has a better record than many cities, the disparities are very noticeable. What keeps you from biking? What keeps your friends, family, or colleagues from biking? There has been a lot of academic research and discussion on this topic, but we want to hear from you.</p>
<p>Join us for a casual discussion of what keeps women, trans, and femme folks from biking more, or at all. Bring your ideas, gripes, solutions, concerns, and encouragement for others. Based on this discussion we may schedule future sessions on more specific topics, such as errands, biking with kids, male culture in recreational biking, biking groups for WTF, or other topics that come out of this.</p>
<p>*Women and men here are used as a shorthand, and not meant to be binary or exclusive. For this event, we are asking that only people who identify as female, trans, or nonbinary. We want to be able to speak freely amongst ourselves.</p>
<p>Madison Bikes board members Heather Pape and Robbie Webber will be joined by Zia Brucaya from the Madison Area MPO as hosts, but this discussion is for you, not us.</p>

<p>The 2015 Bicycle Plan recommended increasing the use of bicycles by city agencies and providing support for local businesses to use bicycles for freight, cargo and other uses. Join us during Bike Week to learn more about how cargo bikes are being used right here in Madison by City departments as well as by local businesses. Learn more, ask questions and discuss how you and your business could make use of this environmentally friendly, healthy mode of transportation.</p>

<p>Do you think there should be mountain bike facilities on the north and east sides of Madison? So do we, and here’s a good chance to let the right people know. We’re teaming up with Madison Parks and the Madison Skatepark Fund to build enthusiasm for more and better amenities for our sports by hosting pop-up Wheel Spots, where people can get an idea of the possibilities. We’ll have our mobile features there, and the skaters are bringing something for the small-wheel crowd. Get on your self-propelled wheeled conveyance of choice and join us!</p>
