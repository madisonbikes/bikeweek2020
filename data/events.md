Have a bike you'd like to donate to someone who can't afford one? Drop it off at one of our participating bike donation locations around the city during Madison Bike Week!





During Madison Bike Week, September 12-20, Free Bikes 4 Kidz Madison is partnering with some local organizations to collect bike donations. If you have a gently used bike that you no longer need and want it to have a new owner that wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford one, please consider donating it to Free Bikes 4 Kidz! 



Each year, Free Bikes 4 Kidz Madison gives over 1,000 bikes to low income and underserved communities throughout Dane County. We’ve set a lofty goal of giving away 2,000 bikes in 2021 but we need your help to make it happen!

- 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM
- Sponsored by [Madison Bikes](https://madisonbikes.org/) and [Madison Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO)](https://www.greatermadisonmpo.org/)

Throughout the U.S., women* bike less than men* for transportation, recreation, and sport. Why? Even in Madison, which has a better record than many cities, the disparities are very noticeable. What keeps you from biking? What keeps your friends, family, or colleagues from biking? There has been a lot of academic research and discussion on this topic, but we want to hear from you. 



Join us for a casual discussion of what keeps women, trans, and femme folks from biking more, or at all. Bring your ideas, gripes, solutions, concerns, and encouragement for others. Based on this discussion we may schedule future sessions on more specific topics, such as errands, biking with kids, male culture in recreational biking, biking groups for WTF, or other topics that come out of this. 



*Women and men here are used as a shorthand, and not meant to be binary or exclusive. For this event, we are asking that only people who identify as female, trans, or nonbinary. We want to be able to speak freely amongst ourselves. 



Madison Bikes board members Heather Pape and Robbie Webber will be joined by Zia Brucaya from the Madison Area MPO as hosts, but this discussion is for you, not us.

Do you think there should be mountain bike facilities on the north and east sides of Madison? So do we, and here's a good chance to let the right people know. We're teaming up with Madison Parks and the Madison Skatepark Fund to build enthusiasm for more and better amenities for our sports by hosting pop-up Wheel Spots, where people can get an idea of the possibilities. We'll have our mobile features there, and the skaters are bringing something for the small-wheel crowd. Get on your self-propelled wheeled conveyance of choice and join us!
